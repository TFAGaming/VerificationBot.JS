# Setup your bot:

First of all, your bot should have Administrator permission, or All permissions except Administrator. 

Your bot will not work if it's a public bot, because you have only one role to give in `config.json`.

Your bot can be hosted 24/7 with uptimerobot.

# Setup the code:

Go to ``config.json`` file, set your server's verified role id there.

Then, go to Secrets (.env): Set in the ``KEY`` case _TOKEN_ and in the ``VALUE`` case, set your bot's token.

Run your bot by clicking on the ``RUN`` button above.

# Issues or problems Fixed:

If you want to create your discord bot, go there: https://www.discord.com/developers/applications (You can get your bot's token there.)

If your bot keeps shutting down, use UptimeRobot. Go there: https://www.uptimerobot.com (If you still don't know how to host your Replit project on UptimeRobot, try to search a tutorial on Youtube, it's easy!)

# Setup the verification bot on your server:

Your bot's prefix is ``!``. To setup the verification message, just type ``!verify``. (@everyone can use this command.)
